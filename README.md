- 👋 Hi, I’m @Claudiacamero
- 👀 I’m interested in tools for technical writers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to collaborate more efficiently via GitHub and its repositories.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... technical writing tips?
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can ping me on Slack or send me an email at Claudia.alejandra.camero.echavarri@ibm.com. I tried to shorten my Slack user but to no avail, so I guess people who contact me will learn my full name.
